# Creative Enviornments Journal

A weekly journal for the _Creative Making: Advanced Visualisation and Computational Environments_ course with Pheonix Perry. 

# Week 0
Retroactively writing this journal entry: I will admit I did not know much about what this course syllabus would entail going in, but what an exciting first lecture. I love the fact that the study of "creative enviornments" is generalized to both physical and digital worlds and that we will be looking at "play" in all its manifestations. Very exciting!

# Week 1
Our first game creation assignment:
> Devise a rule system for a multiplayer game on how to move from the start of the line to the end of the line.

I worked with a team of 4 and our brainstorming meandered in interesting ways (in fact it took a while until we all agreed on what the prompt actually meant ðŸ˜…). Eventually I came up with the idea of playing as Boris Johnson trying to cross London to attend a party at 10 Downing St. while avoiding lockdown rules and the press. The idea was instantly understandable by everyone around the table, but the real work was figuring out how to distill this abstract idea into a complete playable game with a beginning, middle, and end.

Our two major objectives we were trying to balance were:

1. How to reinforce the political message through the gameplay mechanics 
2. How do we make the game interesting enough so that there is actual value in playing it as opposed to just a though experiment


Both these issues were addressed by adding a new player type to the game: the commoner. The commoner's objective would be to simply go from their home to the hospital to visit a sick relative while the MP would need to travel a longer path from picking up alchohol passing through Westminister and eventually reaching Downing street. The twist, however, is that the MP would have a relatively easy time achieving their goal while the commoner would hit constant obstacles related to covid restrictions. 

This solved both our problems by really driving home the message that there is _One rule for us, another rule for them_, and also improving the gameplay by adding a new, fun competitive elmement.

We brought a paper prototype to class and it was a real success: the MPs gleedfully rode to Downing street while the commoner complained each turn about it being unfair.

One value of the game is that many of the textual elements were pulled directly from the news, and we felt this was an effective way to bring a fresh perspective to current events. In fact, we thought it would be worthwhile to rapidly prototype this game as a web experience and hopefully release it into the world soon as a playable game that can be shared across the web.

# Week 2
Introduction to Unity!

I always felt like Unity was beyond my "realm". Like it was reserved for a special class of "gamers" that didn't include me. So it was excited to be introduced to it via the future learn as much more accessible than I anticipated. 

As a former frontend software developer, I was surprised how similar many of the programming techniques are to game engineering (managing state, updating UI, thining through UX experience).

For my game, I took a humorous look at the art world with a Unity game called **Are You An Artist?**

In the quick 1 minute game, you have a chance to decorate a canvas with either 8-bit Marilyn Monroes Cambell Soup stamps. When the time is up, a digital Andy Warhol will either applud your camp art and congradulate you for being an artist, or insult your failed attempt and let you know you don't have what it takes to make it in the New York art scene. 

When I presented this game in class, I was very careful not to reveal the underlying logic of which canvases were considered art and which were "trash". I was surprised by how offended, annoyed, and frustrated people were when they failed and how ready they were to try again and again until they won. It's a small game, but I do think it highlights the arbitrary nature of what art gets elevated to the elite gallery world and what gets left behind. The art in NYC galleries may be good, but it's not inherently the best.

For those reading this journal, the mechanic is actually surprisingly simple: if there is an even number of stamps you fail, if it's odd you win. 

You can try out the game for yourself [here](https://adamcole.itch.io/are-you-an-artist).

# Week 3
This week our task is to create a physical game. When I first read the prompt my outlook was incredibly limited to classic playground games like tag, hopscotch or capture the flag. The lecture on the topic opened my mind to consider games that break the physical and temporal closure that classic playground games take for granted.

I once again met with my group and the brainstorm was an interesting excercise in...having a well-intentioned but somewhat unproductive session. Without a clear constraint to latch onto, we kept jumping from idea to idea, constantly bringing up new examples, and starting from scratch again and again. The mood was always positive, and it was a thoughtful excersice, but after 3 hours of it we all agreed our brains were fried. We agreed to take the discussion we had home with us and each present an indenepent idea to share with the group the following day. The plan is to select our favorite from the bunch and further workshop it. 

The following was my submission to the group Slack.

**The No Fun, Very Very Not Good Gaming Arcadium**<br/>
I just finished the queering controls article (which on the whole was a bit of a slouch to read), but I did enjoy the conclusion, specifically this quote:

>I propose that we can and should create gameplay experiences by taking players out of the flow state and away from seamless, invisible experience. Let the game be slow. Let players be bored, or frustrated, or, with their informed consent, any number of the other emotions that are part of the spectrum of human experience beyond the limited set that flow and industry best practices encourage. As Bo Ruberg suggests, let the game be "no fun" (2015).

I began to think what "games" could I create that could "Annoy, Anger, Disappoint, Sadden and Hurt"*. My first idea is a game called _"Find the Needle in the Haystack"_, and it would play out exactly like it sounds. This seemed like a good enough start, but it turns out a performance artist did something simmilarish in 2014, so I thought what if we created an "Arcade" full of no-fun games.


My next game idea is called _"watching the paint dry"_. In this one, a wall is given a fresh line of paint. Each player will have to guess when the paint is dry by touching the wall. If they touch too early, there will still be paint on their finger and they will lose. The winner is the last one standing or the first person to correctly guess when the paint is dry.
If we like the idea, and think the full "Arcade" adds to the concept, we could come up with another one or two.
